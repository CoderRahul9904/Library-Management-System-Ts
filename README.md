# 📚 Library Management System (TypeScript)

A **Library Management System** built using **TypeScript**, designed to manage and display information about books in a library. This project showcases TypeScript fundamentals, modularized code, and efficient bundling using Webpack.

## 🚀 Features

- **Book Search and Display**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre, with results displayed in a well-organized interface.
- **Modular Components**: Each component is split into separate TypeScript files for maintainability and reusability.
- **Efficient Bundling**: Uses Webpack to compile and bundle TypeScript modules into optimized JavaScript files, ensuring fast load times and a seamless user experience.
- **Simple, Clean UI**: Basic HTML and CSS used for layout and styling, focusing on readability and usability.
- **Custom State Management**: Local state management to handle book data, search results, and selected book details.
